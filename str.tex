\begin{abstract}


This work investigates the use of speculative processing techniques in geo-distributed, partially replicated transactional data stores. 

First, we tackle the problem of formalizing desirable atomicity and isolation guarantees in presence of speculative operations that may expose uncommitted data  to both active  transactions and external clients. We do so by introducing SPeculative Snapshot Isolation (SPSI), a novel consistency criterion that extends the well-known Snapshot Isolation semantics in an intuitive, yet rigorous way.

SPSI serves as the theoretical foundation on top of which we design and implement \specula, a transactional data store that incorporates an innovative set of speculative concurrency control techniques that allow to achieve up to 3.47$\times$ throughput gains and 14$\times$ latency reduction with popular benchmarks like TPC-C and Rubis. Further, \specula integrates self-tuning mechanisms that
dynamically adjusts the aggressiveness of the speculative mechanisms based on the workload characteristics. This allows \specula to maximize the performance gains it attains in workloads where speculation is likely to succeed, as well as to provide robust performance even when faced with unfavourable workloads that suffer of high mispeculation rates.

%%The performance of geographically distributed data stores is challenged by the existence of ineluctably large communication delays between datacenters, which exacerbates the costs induced to ensure consistency of replicated data.
% This article introduces \specula (Speculative Transactional Replication), a geo-replicated transactional data-store that exploits speculative concurrency control techniques to mask the latency of inter data-center synchronization. \specula departs from conventional designs of strongly consistent transactional data store, which  conservatively block transactions whenever they attempt to access data  updated by concurrently executing transactions. Conversely, \specula adopts a speculative approach, which avoids blocking transactions by allowing them to observe the updates produced by concurrent (pre-committed) transactions. This allows 
% 
% The evaluation indicates when there is non-trivial degree of local contention, the advantages stemming from embracing the risk of cascading aborts largely outweigh its drawbacks. On the other hand, \specula's weak consistency model, SPeculative Snapshot Isolation (SPSI), allow programmers to externalize the results of a transaction while this is still undergoing its commit/certification phase, hence allowing for further enhancing  throughput and latency. A key distinguishing treat of SPSI is that it provides clear and stringent guarantees on the atomicity and isolation of the snapshots observed and produced during transaction execution. This spares programmers from having to cope with complex concurrency bugs that could arise when using alternative weakly consistent models, like eventual consistency.
%
%We performed an extensive evaluation, using a micro benchmark and two realistic workloads (TPC-C and RUBiS). The results show that comparing with a state-of-the-art transactional protocol, our strong consistency approach greatly increases throughput when there is non-trivial degree of local contention (which is the case for TPC-C and RUBiS), and allowing externalizing speculative results and pipelining transactions (the weak consistency model) reduces latency and even gives further speedup.
%This design choice allows \specula to achieve  up to XX$\times$ higher throughput and up to YY$\times$ lower latency than in state of the art strongly-consistent data stores., which suggests that, in geo-replicated datastores, the advantages stemming from embracing the risk of cascading aborts largely outweigh its drawbacks.

%\section{Conclusion}
%This paper proposed {\specula}, a novel protocol that uses speculative techniques to improve performance of distributed transactions. The three novel speculative techniques, i.e. speculative commit, speculative read and precise clock, collectively mitigate the performance bottleneck of existing transactional protocol. Extensive benchmark showed that our protocol achieves significantly higher throughput than state of the art non-speculative system and is particularly beneficial when workloads have high local conflict and low remote conflict.
